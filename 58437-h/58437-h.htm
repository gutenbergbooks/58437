<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">Henry Cabot Lodge,</span><br />
<span class="indent"><i>United States Senate</i>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> In response to an informal request made by your secretary of
Mr. Bliss, of this department, on February 12, 1921, I have the honor
to inclose for your consideration and that of your committee a copy
of a letter, with its inclosures which I wrote to Mr. Porter, chairman
of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House, on the subject of
French black troops on the Rhine; also a copy of a later letter to
Mr. Porter, with its inclosure, a copy of a telegram from Mr. Wallace,
giving the latest figures as to the number of French colonial troops
now in the occupied territory.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">January 17, 1921.</span></p>

<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">Stephen G. Porter,</span><br />
<span class="indent"><i>House of Representatives</i>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
January 10, 1921, with which you inclose a copy of House joint resolution
No. 433, introduced by Mr. Britten, and request that I furnish
the Committee on Foreign Affairs with such facts concerning the
conduct of French colored troops in the occupied territories of Germany
as may be in the possession of the Department of State.</p>

<p>Protests concerning the conduct of French black troops in the
Rhenish area began to reach the department toward the end of May,
1920. On June 12, 1920, a telegram was sent to the American embassy
in Paris requesting information as to the truth of these allegations
and asking what representations might be made to the French
Government, if the reports appeared to have a basis of fact. (Appendix
I). On June 25, 1920, Mr. Wallace telegraphed that an investigation
had been promptly started and that he would arrange
with Gen. Allen, in command of the American troops at Coblentz,
to secure all possible facts. In a further telegram of this same date
Mr. Wallace gave a short summary of the number of colonial troops
employed by the French in the occupied territories, reported what
Mr. Dresel, American commissioner in Berlin, had told him of the
agitation in Germany, and suggested that he speak informally of the
matter to M. Millerand. (Appendix II.) The Department of State
authorized Mr. Wallace to speak to M. Millerand on the subject, and
he reported on July 22 that this had been done. (Appendix II.)</p>

<p>In the meantime, on June 22, the department telegraphed Gen.
Allen for such information as he might be able to furnish. This
telegram was answered shortly on June 26, giving the number and
origin of French colonial troops in the occupied region and an official
report of the number of complaints made to the French during the
period of occupation and the disposition made of these complaints.
(Appendix IV.) On July 2 Gen. Allen submitted a full and detailed
report on the matter (Appendix V), in which he pointed out that the
allegations of wholesale atrocities were false and intended for political
propaganda, that there had been cases of serious misbehavior which
had been punished by the French military authorities, that the
number of convictions indicated an earnest effort on the part of the
French authorities to deal justly with the accusations, and that
the discipline of the Senegalese troops had not always been good.
I especially commend this report to your attention as a clear and
impartial statement of the case. That the French are attempting to
maintain good relations with the people of the territory occupied by
their armies is made evident in a telegram from Gen. Allen of August
19, in which he cites a French order instructing that &#8220;all members
of the Army must be dignified, courteous, and just, thus setting the
example to the German population of tolerance in order that good
will and mutual respect may be established and promoted and ill
will and hatred overcome.&#8221; (Appendix VI.)</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>The department also consulted in this matter the American
commissioner in Berlin, stating on June 15, 1920, that it was receiving
many protests against the alleged misconduct of French black troops
and that the phrasing of the protests suggested possible inspiration
from a propaganda bureau. (Appendix VII.) Mr. Dresel replied
that protests in Germany were general, emanating from all classes
and political parties, that an extensive press propaganda had been
carried on and that a mass meeting of protest was soon to be held in
Berlin at which certain Americans were to speak. Mr. Dresel inclosed
a memorandum on this subject. You will note in this memorandum
which includes translations from the German press and a
summary of the discussion in the Reichstag, various examples of
gross exaggeration of facts, as, for example, the statement of the
German foreign minister that France had transplanted &#8220;50,000
black and colored troops to the heart of white Europe,&#8221; whereas
Gen. Allen stated that the number of such troops, including regiments
of Arabs, was in the vicinity of 20,000. May I call your particular
attention in this memorandum also to the translation of the French
answer to the German protests? I understand that there has been
no official interchange of notes between the French and German
Governments.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresel forwarded to the department also the original German
edition of the pamphlet, &#8220;Colored Frenchmen on the Rhine,&#8221; the
American edition of which, published by the New Times of Chicago,
appears to be a literal translation with the addition of the words,
&#8220;An appeal of white women to American womanhood.&#8221; It is
perhaps worth noting that this pamphlet was published not in the
Rhineland, but in Berlin, and that the avoidance of names makes it
impossible to verify or disprove the specific allegations. Furthermore
as Mr. Dresel has pointed out to the department, practically all the
alleged instances of misconduct by the French black troops cited in
the German press give no reference to date or place and are therefore
of little value as evidence.</p>

<p>On July 15 the American commissioner in Berlin sent to the
department a translation of an account of the so-called American
protest meeting against the use by France of colored troops in the
Rhineland area, which was held in Berlin on the evening of July 4.
In his covering dispatch Mr. Dresel pointed out that the addresses
were bitterly anti-American as well as anti-French and that Miss
Ray Beveridge and Mr. Scheffauer, both American citizens, were
particularly vehement in their attacks on the American Government.
I have thought it worth while to inclose this dispatch, with the
accompanying translation, to call your attention to the competence
of the witnesses on whose allegations this propaganda appears in
large measure to be based.</p>

<p>Miss Ray Beveridge was formerly employed by the German
embassy in Washington and was the organizer of &#8220;embargo conference&#8221;
meetings in 1915. She states that she held a public meeting
in the Reichstag Building to protest against the signing of the peace
treaty. She refers to the former Emperor of Germany as &#8220;my
Kaiser.&#8221; Mr. Edwin Emerson, formerly a newspaper man in Berlin
connected with the antially Continental Times, has been living in
Germany since 1917. During and since the war he has been carrying
on antiallied propaganda work in Germany. John W. DeKay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was identified with the Huerta dictatorship and attempted to import
into Mexico rifles and ammunition, which were intercepted by the
United States at Vera Cruz. He was indicted on nine counts in New
York in 1913 for obtaining money on false pretenses and is a fugitive
from justice in the Atlantic National Bank case. He is said to be
the treasurer of the bolshevist party in Switzerland. He carried a
Mexican passport in December, 1920, and was at one time granted
a German passport by the German legation in Berne. Mr. H. G.
Scheffauer, born in San Francisco in 1878, has lived in Germany
since 1913. As coeditor of the Continental Times he contributed
anti-American articles under assumed names. On January 6, 1919,
he was indicted for treason&mdash;for writing, publishing, and distributing
articles and propaganda in aid of the German cause. These people
call themselves Americans, and as far as the department knows are
the authors of most of the stories distributed in this country concerning
the misconduct of the French black troops. It is necessary
to speak of the Englishman, E. D. Morel, only because he is specifically
mentioned in House joint resolution No. 433. Mr. Morel was,
before the war, strongly anti-French and anti-Belgian. During the
Moroccan crisis he upheld Germany and during the war was indicted
under the defense of the realm act for sending uncensored letters to
Switzerland. His articles on the &#8220;Black Terror&#8221; were published in
the London Daily Herald, an extremely radical paper alleged to be
subsidized by the Russian soviet government.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be called to the attention of your committee that
these accusations against the French troops are also reaching America
direct from Germany. As evidence of this there are inclosed
photostat copies of two printed appeals sent in the mail from Germany
to American citizens and by them forwarded to the department.
The leaflet entitled &#8220;The Black Evil&#8221; reached America inclosed in
a German magazine. You will note that there is no printer&#8217;s mark
and that the American flag at the top is evidently intended to indicate
that it was printed in America. Several of these leaflets have
reached the department and copies have been sent to the Postmaster
General for such action as he may see fit to take. The second leaflet,
entitled &#8220;An Appeal to Americans,&#8221; contains the accusation against
the French colored troops only as a further argument for American
assistance.</p>

<p>As soon as the department received word of the introduction of
House joint resolution No. 433 I telegraphed to Mr. Wallace for
information as to the present personnel of the French troops of
occupation. When his answer is received I shall be pleased to
forward it to you. May I, however, call your attention to the fact
that no recent allegations of misconduct of French soldiers have been
made so far as the department is informed, all those detailed in the
various published statements referring to a time prior to June 1, 1920.</p>

<p>In consideration of what I have said above, the facts that, although
there were undoubtedly outrages, those proved guilty have been
punished; that official American testimony as well as that given by
many reputable Germans largely disproves the specific but unverifiable
charges made by witnesses whose impartiality is certainly
questionable; that the accusations appear to be a method of anti-French
propaganda; that the French have long since withdrawn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Senegalese troops which were the only pure Negro troops used; that
there appear to be no accusations against the behavior of such
French colonial troops as remain in the occupied territories; that Mr.
Wallace has already discussed the matter with the French prime
minister, it would appear to me inadvisable that the American
Government should be asked to take any further action at the present
time.</p>

<p>I am very glad to be able to furnish you with full information in
this matter and request only that the inclosures herewith be considered
as for your confidential use and that of the members of your
committee.</p>

<p>Department is receiving telegrams and letters protesting against
the use of African troops in occupied Germany by the French. Please
give your views as to the truth of the accusations being made against
the behavior of these troops and whether you believe these accusations
are well founded. Advise department what you deem advisable
in the way of representations to the French Government on this
subject. It is not department&#8217;s desire to lend too credulous an ear
to these sensational reports and yet it may be of interest to the
French Government to know that such reports are being persistently

not being fully refuted.</p>

<span class="indent3"><i>Washington:</i></span></p>

<p>Gen. Allen reports that there are at present in occupied Germany
regiments of Moroccans, Algerians, Zouaves, and Malgaches, but no
Senegalese. According to my understanding the Algerian troops
comprise natives of Algeria of French and French Arab stock, and
some Mahomedans, not Negroes. The Moroccan regiments comprise
Arabs and Mahomedans, not Negroes. The Malgaches are Malays
from Madagascar, and the Zouaves are special infantry regiments,
not Negroes.</p>

<p>Mixed blacks. Senegalese are Negroes.</p>

<p>The American commissioner states that agitation against the black
troops is carried on by papers of all political opinions, that the German
Government has formally protested to the French Government, that
complaints have come from men of all classes, that the papers claim
that America should understand the situation on account of our
Negro question and charge that assaults have been made on German
women, but that the facts can not be checked and that the American
consul reported deep anger of population of Frankfort and vicinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
over use of black troops. These troops have been withdrawn.
French newspapers have denied German press reports on several
occasions, but I have seen no official denial in the press or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Minister of War Lefevre, speaking in the chamber on June 17
regarding the army budget and the future of the French black troops,
stated: &#8220;As for our black troops, we shall not tolerate the interested
criticisms which are being made on the other side of the Rhine.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is my belief that it would be a friendly act to inform Millerand
that department is receiving many telegrams and letters of protest
and that it may interest the French Government to know that the
persistent reports are not fully refuted and are having a harmful
effect upon public opinion.</p>

<p>Your June 22, 5 p. m., regarding alleged mistreatment by French
colored troops of German women. The average number of French
Negro troops on the Rhine from January, 1919, to June, 1920, was
5,200. The number of North African troops, Arabs, and mixed
blood, 20,000. All regiments of pure Negroes (Senegalese) were
removed June 5, one regiment of Madagascar troops and a few individual
Negro or Negroid remaining in other colonial troops. During
entire period of occupation there were 66 cases of actual or alleged
rape, sodomy, or similar offenses reported to French officials. The
action taken resulted in 28 convictions, 11 acquittals, the other cases
not being completed. The offenses included some insulting proposals
and offensive conduct toward German women. The sentences
varied from 30 days, to 10 years, confinement. Widespread reports
and complaints in the German press are based on the foregoing cases
and some others not officially reported to French officials, and while
these reports have some foundation they are undoubtedly greatly
exaggerated and are being used as propaganda against the French
troops and are inspired by possibilities of war animosity. Investigation
continuing. Full report follows.</p>

<span class="gap"><span class="gap"><span class="smcap">Interallied Rhineland High Commission,</span></span></span><br />
<span class="gap"><span class="smcap">American Department,</span></span><br />
<i>Coblenz, Germany, July 2, 1920</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> 1. In compliance with your cablegram of June 22, 1920,
regarding alleged mistreatment of German women by French colored
troops, and in elaboration of my cablegram of June 28, I submit
the following report, based on a personal investigation conducted
by Col. Le Vert Coleman, C. A. C., American liaison officer with the
commanding general of the allied forces of occupation.</p>

<p>2. During the period from January, 1919, to June 1, 1920:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The average number of Negro troops in the French Army of
the Rhine was 5,200 men.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The average number of French colonial troops composed of
natives of Africa not of pure Negro blood, including distinct races
such as Arabs from Algeria, Moroccans, etc., and mixed blood races,
such as the Malgaches from Madagascar, who are Negroids, was 20,000
men. During the entire period from the first day of the occupation
in 1918, to the 1st of June, 1920, 66 cases of alleged rape, attempted
rape, sodomy, or attempted sodomy have been officially reported to
the French military authorities, against their colored colonial troops
in the occupied territories of the Rhinelands. Among these cases,
there have been 28 convictions, including several cases where the
intent was not fully proved, but punishment was given by minor
courts corresponding to our summary and garrison courts, for indecent
proposals and obscene handling of women and girls against their will.
There have been 11 acquittals. There have been 23 investigations
leading to trials, the results of which have not been published yet.
There have been 6 cases where the offenders could not be found.
The penalties inflicted have been varied; from 10 years at hard labor
for aggravated cases of rape, to 30 days in prison for indecent mishandling
of women.</p>

<p>3. At the present time, the Senegalese brigade having all left
the Rhinelands between June 1 and 6, 1920, there actually remains
but one regiment of troops of Negroid origin, the First Regiment of
Chasseurs Malgaches. There are, however, a few individual Negroes
or Negroids in the other French colonial regiments.</p>

<p>4. A very violent newspaper campaign attacking the French
colonial troops, especially the Negro troops, broke out simultaneously
throughout Germany coincident with the time of the French evacuation
of Frankfurt and Darmstadt, and has continued up to the present
time. It is unquestionably a fact that many gross exaggerations
were circulated in the German press concerning the conduct of the
French colonial troops. The allegations in the German press have
been, for the most part, so indefinite as to time and place, and circumstance,
as to leave it impracticable to verify the alleged facts,
or to disprove them.</p>

<p>5. After all proper allowance is made for the natural difficulties,
which always are to be expected in tracing crimes of this nature,
due to the shame and distress of the victims, the great mass of the
articles in the German press, by the simultaneous appearance all
over Germany, and by the failure to cite time, place, and circumstance
sufficiently clear to enable the truth to be ascertained, give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to an impartial observer the impression of an adroit political move
which would tend to sow antipathy to France in the other lands of
the allied and associated powers, especially in America, where the
Negro question is always capable of arousing feeling.</p>

<p>6. The Rheinische Zeitung and the Kolnische Volkszeitung,
recently suspended for publishing attacks on the French colored
colonial troops, admit under date of June 15, that they employed certain
terms and expressions which they might better have omitted, due
to the imperfection of the news coming for the most part from outside
sources, says the Volkszeitung, and from Berlin says the Rheinische
Zeitung. This tends to bear out the opinion noted above, which is
further strengthened by dissentant voices in the South German press
which protests against exaggerated accusations by other German
papers against colored French troops.</p>

<p>7. These exaggerated attacks in the German press outside of the
Rhinelands have, in several cases, been refuted by responsible officials
(German) and citizens of the Rhinelands.</p>

<p>Herr Kohler, mayor of Worms; Herr Bischoff, police commissioner
of Worms, referring to the Senegalese troops, reports to the
Interallied Rhineland High Commission, that with the exception of
one incident, the Senegalese troops in Worms have not committed
any misdemeanor and have been under perfect discipline during their
entire stay in Worms.</p>

<p>Herr Levy, from Kreuznach, and several Germans, have written
open letters protesting against what they term unfair exaggerations
in the German press against the troops.</p>

<p>8. Among gross exaggerations in the German press may be cited
the following:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Claim that there are 40,000 colored French troops in the
Palatinate.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Claim that Frankfort was occupied by 20,000 men entirely
formed of Negro (Senegalese) troops. French official report shows
that no Senegalese occupied Frankfort, but first Moroccan and Algerian
tirailleurs and later French troops (white).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Numerous atrocities in the Saar, where young women are said
to have been forcibly abducted, raped, mutilated, killed, and their
bodies thrown into manure piles. The burgermeister of Saarbrucken,
the inspector of the Caserne Petain, Herr Welsch, proprietor of the
manure pile; Wilhelm Roth, caretaker; Herr Geppert, employee,
have all given written and oral testimony wholly refuting the accusations.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Claim of the German press that large numbers of young Austrian
girls who had come to the vicinity of Mainz to get away from
the famine in Austria were raped. The Austrian Government is
reported to have made an investigation through its consular service
and to have found that not a single such case had occurred.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Investigation by Col. Bonvialle, commanding the Twelfth
Tirailleurs, May 21, 1920, concerning charges of sodomy near Euskirchen,
with medical report, indicates that the charges could not
be sustained.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Claims in the Nauen Radio Service on April 29, 1920, that the
working people of Alsace-Lorraine had protested, demanding the
removal of the Moroccan division from Alsace-Lorraine, when there
was no part of those troops in Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>9. On the other hand, undoubtedly many instances have occurred
where women or girls have been assaulted and some where boys and
men have been sodomized by members of the French colored colonial
troops. See report above as to the official figures. There are
undoubtedly cases which are not included in the official figures, due to
the natural desire to keep out of obscene notoriety. For example,
a case of attempted assault was reported June 14, 1920, from Saarbrucken
which is not included in the French official figures. Some
cases will never come to light, due to the natural feeling of shame
of the women concerned, but they are, in my opinion, cases such as
generally occur in any land when soldiery is for a long time quartered
upon the population.</p>

<p>10. The impression gained from contact with and observation of
the French colonial troops is that, as a general rule, they are quiet,
orderly, and well behaved. Discipline has a purely relative value
and is hardly of the same order as that which we would require.
That the discipline of the Senegalese brigade was not always good,
is established by the incidents which recently occurred at Marseille,
when a part of these troops committed serious infractions of discipline
when ordered aboard their transports.</p>

<p>11. The attitude of certain classes of German women toward the
colored troops has been such as to incite trouble. On account of the
very unsettled economic conditions, and for other causes growing out
of the World War, prostitution is abnormally engaged in and many
German prostitutes and women of loose character have openly made
advances to the colored soldiers, as evidenced by numerous love
letters and photographs which are now on file in the official records
and which have been sent by German women to colored French
soldiers. Several cases have occurred of marriages of German
women with French Negro soldiers. One German girl of a first-class
burgher family, her father a very high city functionary of a prominent
city in the Rhinelands, recently procured a passport to rejoin her
fiance in Marseille. He was a Negro sergeant. Other Negro
soldiers have had French wives here, and the color line is not regarded
either by the French or the Germans as we regard it in America; to
keep the white race pure. At Ludwigshafen, when the Seventh
Tirailleurs left for Frankfurt, patrols had to be sent out to drive away
the German women from the barracks, where they were kissing the
colored troops through the window gratings.</p>



<h3>CONCLUSIONS.</h3>

<p>I. The wholesale atrocities by French Negro colonial troops
alleged in the German press, such as the alleged abductions, followed
by rape, mutilation, murder, and concealment of the bodies of the
victims are false and intended for political propaganda.</p>

<p>II. A number of cases of rape, attempted rape, sodomy, attempted
sodomy, and obscene mishandling of women and girls have occurred
on the part of French Negro colonial troops in the Rhinelands. These
cases have been occasional and in restricted numbers, not general or
widespread. The French military authorities have repressed them
severely in most cases and have made a very serious effort to stamp
the evil out. The amount of evidence necessary to convict in such
cases is a very delicate matter to express opinion upon. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the number of acquittals is not large and there is nothing surprising
about these acquittals, except in one case where a girl of 14 years was
known carnally. In this case the acquittal followed upon the claim
that the girl had consented.</p>

<p>III. As a rule the number of convictions and the thoroughness of
the reports of the investigations and trials indicate the very earnest
effort of the French trial authorities to do justice and to stamp out
the evil by stern repressive measures. That their sentences are often
milder than ours would be is largely due to extenuating circumstances
found in the evidence according to their rules of evidence
which are very different from ours, and to the fact that in general
French courts do not punish these crimes as severely as American
and English courts do.</p>

<p>IV. The discipline of the Senegalese Tirailleurs was not always
good as evidenced by the refusal of some of them to get aboard
transports at Marseille when ordered to Syria.</p>

<span class="indent3"><i>Washington, D. C.:</i></span></p>

<p>In a communication from the French high commissioner to the
general commanding the French Army of occupation the former
requests that instructions be given all members of that Army concerning
their relations with and attitude toward German civilians.
The French general has adopted the suggestion, and by means of
conferences, orders, and schools in the units of his command, is
instructing all officers and men that the occupying forces are not in
Germany to provoke the Germans but as a guaranty that the terms
of the treaty shall be carried out and that all members of the Army
must be dignified, courteous, and just, thus setting the example to
the German population of tolerance in order that good will and mutual
respect may be established and promoted and ill will and hatred overcome.
This is most encouraging and hopeful and should be productive
of great good. This has been the governing principle of the
American occupation, and since coming to the commission I have
urged the application of this principle throughout the entire occupied
region. Millerand has heartily approved the action of the French
high commissioners and of the commanding general. Recently
French relations have been more antagonistic than at any other
period since the signing of the peace treaty.</p>

<p>Your 625, June 15, 11 a. m.</p>

<p>Department is in receipt of frequent protests from various organizations
and individuals against conduct of French troops in occupied
region, particularly alleged mistreatment of German women by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
French black troops. The wording of these protests suggests that
they are inspired by a propaganda agency and are based on reports
in German press. Department assumes that you are not in a position
to definitely determine the facts in the matter but requests your
opinion. Please forward by mail press clippings and other information
you may be able to obtain on the subject.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Secretary of State,</span><br />
<span class="indent3"><i>Washington.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> Adverting to my dispatch No. 442, of July 5, and to my telegrams
Nos. 806 and 807, of July 12, and No. 812, of July 15, I have the
honor to transmit herewith a translation of a newspaper account of
the so-called American protest meeting against the use by France of
colored troops in the occupied Rhineland area, held in Berlin on the
evening of July 14. I beg likewise to inclose a copy of the issue of
the European Press (formerly the Continental Times) dated July 9,
which contains an article by Rutledge Rutherford announcing the
meeting in question. This article states that the American speakers
were to be Col. Edwin Emerson, Miss Ray Beveridge, Hermann
George Scheffauer, Edith Talbot Scheffauer, Lora Vincent, John
De Kay, Rutledge Rutherford, and Agatha M. Bullitt. The three
last-named persons did not actually appear, however, although
messages were read from Messrs. De Kay and Rutherford. Other
than these Americans, the only speaker was a German woman from
the Rhineland; but messages were read from E. D. Morel, Henri
Barbusse, Jean Longuet, and others.</p>

<p>A member of the commission who attended the meeting informs
me that the large auditorium of the university was crowded long before
the meeting opened, and that the audience, composed largely of
women, was most enthusiastic. The newspaper account does not,
however, give an accurate impression of the tone adopted by the
speakers, inasmuch as mention of the bitterly anti-French and anti-American
character of the addresses is apparently omitted, whereas
it was expression of these sentiments which created the greatest applause.
In fact, the meeting took on more the character of a violent
chauvinistic gathering than a protest against the black troops. Miss
Beveridge and Mr. Scheffauer were particularly vehement in their
attacks on President Wilson and the United States Government and
devoted most of their time to assailing America for her entrance into
the war, while Col. Emerson directed his thrusts chiefly at France.
It is interesting to note that Miss Beveridge, who has now spoken more
than once on this subject, is invariably introduced as one who has
done much for German children by aiding the work of the American
Quakers in Germany. The head of the Quaker mission in Berlin
informs me, however, that Miss Beveridge has not now and has never
had any connection with their activities, in spite of her repeated
efforts to become associated with them, and that her persistence and
such misstatements as that referred to above have caused them great
embarrassment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>During the course of the meeting, letters were read from Mrs.
Bayard Taylor and Prof. Thomas C. Hall, but I am inclined to believe
that the writers were not acquainted with the circumstances under
which the meeting was held.</p>

<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">Stephen G. Porter,</span><br />
<span class="indent3"><i>House of Representatives.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> Referring to my letter of January 17, 1921, concerning the
propaganda being carried on as to the conduct of the French black
troops in the occupied territory of Germany, I have the honor to
inclose for your information a paraphrase of a telegram received from
the American ambassador in Paris giving the official statement as
to the number and origin of the French troops of occupation at the
present time.</p>

<p><span class="indent2">I have the honor to be, sir,</span></p>

<p><span class="indent3">Your obedient servant,</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><small>[Telegram from American Ambassador at Paris, Jan. 29, 1921.]</small></p>

<p>The total number of troops in the French Army of occupation was
86,000 in December; 16,386 of this number were Moroccans and
Algerians and 3,224 were Malgaches. The remainder were white.
The figures for January are approximately the same.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, there are no black troops. The Moroccans and
Algerians are Arabs of the Mussulman religion and are entirely distinct
from the Negro race. The Malagaches are Malays from Madagascar.</p>

<p>Incidents occurring between these colored troops and the natives
of the occupied district, and which have been investigated by French
military authorities, have been in the proportion of 1 to 1,594 men.
About one-fourth of such cases have resulted in condemnations of
from 30 days to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment, according to the gravity of
the charge. The remaining cases have been dismissed on account
of inability to substantiate charges or because of a lack of good faith
on the part of German authorities who brought charges.</p>

<p>The French Government has made no attempt to officially disprove
the accusations concerning the behavior of the troops. It has, however,
unofficially supplied facts and figures through its press agencies
to various countries. So far as I am able to ascertain, the recent
behavior of these troops has been on an average with the conditions
above reported.</p>

<p>The delay on the part of the foreign office in supplying this information
after several requests was not due to lack of interest, but to
difficulty in obtaining figures. That office has promised further information
within a few days, which I shall forward as soon as it is
received.</p>

<span class="indent3"><i>House of Representatives.</i></span></p>



<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> Again reverting to my letter of January 17, 1921, in regard to
the House joint resolution No. 433, concerning French colored troops
in occupied Germany, I beg to refer to Appendix X of that letter,
which was a photostat copy of a leaflet entitled &#8220;The Black Evil,&#8221; and
bearing the American flag at the top. This matter was brought to the
attention of the American commissioner in Berlin, with instructions to
make inquiries in regard to its origin.</p>

<p>I am now in receipt of a telegram from Mr. Dresel stating that the
minister for foreign affairs, Mr. Simons, assures him &#8220;emphatically
that the foreign office has had nothing to do with this propaganda,
of which he utterly disapproves as injurious to Germany.&#8221; Mr.
Simons further stated that if he could discover who was financially
responsible for this leaflet he would insist on these activities being
stopped.</p>

<p>I beg to send this information to you as pertinent to the subject of
joint resolution No. 433, which is being examined by your committee.</p>
